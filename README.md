**DESCRIPTION **:

This Java utility program demonstrates how to handle text files in various ways. The program covers the three primary file operations:
Key Requirements and Features:

1 Create a New File or Overwrite an Existing File (Write Operation):

The program should allow the user to write data to a text file.
If the file does not exist, the program should create the file.
If the file already exists, it should overwrite the contents with the new data.

2 Read Content from a File (Read Operation):

The program should allow the user to read and display the contents of an existing file.
It should be able to handle large files by reading and displaying content line by line.

3 Modify (Append) Content to an Existing File (Modify Operation):

The program should allow the user to append new data to an already existing file.
The new content should be added at the end of the file without modifying any of the existing content.

4 Error Handling:

Proper error handling should be implemented to ensure the program can handle issues like file not found, read/write permission issues, or unexpected file errors gracefully.

5 Documentation:

Each method (write, read, and modify) should be clearly documented, explaining what the method does and any input/output involved.

6 User Input:

The program should allow for dynamic input, where the user can specify the file name and content they want to work with.

7 File Operations:

Use FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader classes for efficient file handling.
Support both UTF-8 and default encodings for text files.
1 Write to a File: Create a new file or overwrite an existing file with specified content.
2 Read from a File: Open and read the contents of a text file.
3 Modify (Append) a File: Add new content to an existing file without deleting or altering the original data.
These operations are commonly used for handling file-based data storage in many applications, such as logging, configuration file management, or processing user input.
